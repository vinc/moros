# Contributing to MOROS

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's
fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your
appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:

- Star the project on GitHub
- Talk about it on social media
- Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues

## Did you find a bug?

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under
  [Issues](https://github.com/vinc/moros/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
  [open a new one](https://github.com/vinc/moros/issues/new). Be sure to
  include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as
  possible to reproduce it.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

  Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Suggest your idea by [creating a new discussion](https://github.com/vinc/moros/discussions/new?category=ideas)
- Be aware that MOROS is a personal hobby project with the goal of creating an
  operating system that can fit in one standard human brain and inspiring other
  to do the same.
- If you want an operating system that does more you might want to collaborate
  on a bigger project like [Redox](https://www.redox-os.org/) or
  [Serenity](https://serenityos.org/)
